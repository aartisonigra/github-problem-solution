Muckers
Problem Statement
In the game of Muckers, players throw rings at rods for points. George visits a stall at a city fair where he can win a prize if he successfully places rings of all three colors—red, green, and blue—on a rod.

You need to determine how many rods contain all three colors of rings after all rings have been placed. The input consists of a string S of length 2N, where every two characters represent a color-position pair:

The first character indicates the ring's color ('r' for red, 'g' for green, 'b' for blue).
The second character indicates the rod number (from '0' to '9') where the ring is placed.
 

Input Format
The first and only line of input consists string ‘S’ of length 2N, where every two characters represent a color-position pair.

Output Format
Print the number of rods that have rings of all three colors.

 
Constraints
2<= N <= 5*10^3

Sample Testcase 0
Testcase Input
g2r2g1
Testcase Output
0
Explanation
None of the rod has all the color of rings.
Here the rings are:
Green and Red ring are on rod 2.
Green ring on rod 1.

Sample Testcase 1
Testcase Input
g4r2b1b2g2g1r1r2g2b3g3r4r3
Testcase Output
3
Explanation
We will see that only 1st , 2nd and 3rd rod has all three color of rings.
Here the rings are:
Red, Green and Blue rings on rod 1.
Red, Green and Blue rings on rod 2.
Red, Green and Blue rings on rod 3
Green and Red ring on rod 4.
