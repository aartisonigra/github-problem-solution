Double Array
Problem Statement
Ram is given a sequence of numbers by the wizard Betaal. To free himself from the wizard's spell, Ram must sort this sequence and then concatenate the sorted sequence with itself.

Your task is to help Ram by performing the required operations and generating the final sequence.

Input Format
The first line contains an integer N, representing the number of elements.

The second line contains N space separated integers a1,a2,a3â€¦.an.

Output Format
The output is a sequence that consists of the sorted sequence concatenated with itself, as described in the problem.

Constraints
1 <= N <= 10^6

1 <= Ai <=10^6

Sample Testcase 0
Testcase Input
3
1 2 1
Testcase Output
1 1 2 1 1 2 
Explanation
In the sample case we have first sorted the sequence 1 2 1 -> 1 1 2 and then concatenated that with itself.
Sample Testcase 1
Testcase Input
4
1 2 2 3 
Testcase Output
1 2 2 3 1 2 2 3 
Explanation
In the sample case we have first sorted the sequence 1 2 2 3 -> 1 2 2 3 and then concatenated that with itself.

SOLUTIONS:

import java.util.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        
        // Step 1: Input
        int n = sc.nextInt();
        int[] arr = new int[n];
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            arr[i] = sc.nextInt();
        }

        // Step 2: Sort the array
        Arrays.sort(arr);

        // Step 3: Print the array twice (concatenated with itself)
        for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++) { // run loop twice
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                System.out.print(arr[j] + " ");
            }
        }
    }
}
