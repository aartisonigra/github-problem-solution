SOLTUIONS:
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static String reverseWords(String s) {
        String[] words = s.split(" ");
        StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();

        for (int i = 0; i < words.length; i++) {
            StringBuilder reversed = new StringBuilder(words[i]).reverse();
            result.append(reversed);

            if (i < words.length - 1) {
                result.append(" ");
            }
        }

        return result.toString();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        String s = scanner.nextLine().trim();
        String result = reverseWords(s);
        System.out.println(result);
    }
}
